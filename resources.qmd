### Course Discussion Board

{{< var course.short >}} will use `Piazza` as the course discussion
board. Students are encouraged to direct all questions about course
topics or logistics to Piazza; use of a public anonymous discussion
board allows students to benefit from the insights of their classmates
and allows instructors to answer questions publicly to the benefit 
of all students. 

Students are encouraged to use Piazza's private question feature if
they need to contact the instructor directly. Please only use private
questions for personal inquiries: questions about the technical
substance of the course can and should be asked (pseudonymously) in
the public section of Piazza. 

Piazza login information will be distributed through CUNY Brightspace.

### External Resources Use Policy {#externalresources}

Students are encouraged to make use of any and all external resources, including
generative AI tools, for at home study and for practice problems. 
Students are strongly encouraged to collaborate on weekly practice problems. 
You are ultimately  responsible for the correctness of any submitted materials
- "the AI told me so" is not a valid defense.

The instructor will provide a formula sheet for use during in-class exams. No alternative resources may be used during these activities.

Students may use online resources, such as blog posts, discussion fora, *etc.* 
for the Research Reports and Course Competition but Generative AI tools are 
specifically **disallowed**. 

> Exception: Coding Assistance Tools, *e.g.*, GitHub CoPilot, may be used for
  the Research Reports and Course Competition. Their usage is limited to *coding*
  your ideas. They may not be used as idea generation tools. 
  
The era of Generative AI is challenging and fast-paced. If you are unsure whether
a tool is allowed in this course, please reach out to the instructor before
using it. In matters of Academic Integrity, it is far better to ask permission
than forgiveness. 

## Academic Integrity Policy {#aipolicy}

I fully support CUNY’s [Policy on Academic Integrity](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/08/CUNY-Academic-Integrity-Policy-2024.pdf), which states, in part:

> Academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York. Penalties for academic dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion.

> Academic integrity is at the core of a college or university education. Faculty assign essays, exams, quizzes, projects, and so on both to extend the learning done in the classroom and as a means of assessing that learning. When students violate the academic integrity policy (i.e., "cheat"), they are committing an act of theft that can cause real harm to themselves and others including, but not limited to, their classmates, their faculty, and the caregivers who may be funding their education. Academic dishonesty confers an unfair advantage over others, which undermines educational equity and fairness. Students who cheat place their college’s accreditation and their own future prospects in jeopardy.

In this course, expectations for academic integrity for in-class graded activities
are straightforward: no use of unauthorized materials on weekly quizzes or
mid-semester tests. Unless explicitly stated otherwise by the instructor
*in writing*, the only authorized materials allowed during in class assessment
are the instructor-provided formula sheets.

The Research Reports are "open peers", "open book", "open internet" but you may
not use **paid** services or **generative AI** services. You must cite all sources
used and include an acknowledgement section listing all peers with whom you
collaborated. You do not need to acknowledge the instructor or any Piazza
discussions, but you must acknowledge other faculty members or other Baruch
students who help you complete your reports, even if they are not enrolled in
this course.

Academic sanctions in this class will range from an **F on the Assignment** to
an **F in this Course**. A report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent
to the Office of the Dean of Students. 

Students are encouraged to contact the instructor with any questions or concerns
related to matters of academic integrity.

## Course Accomodations

#### Disability Services

It is [CUNY policy](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/reasonable-accommodations-and-academic-adjustments/v-accommodations/) to provide Accommodations and Academic Adjustments to students with disabilities. 

Any student who has a disability who may need accommodations in this class should register as early as possible with [Student Disability Services](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/student-disability-services/) (SDS). Your registration with Student Disability Services is confidential, and is not recorded on your Baruch Academic Record. SDS can be reached by email at [disability.services@baruch.cuny.edu](mailto:disability.services@baruch.cuny.edu), by phone at [646-312-4590](tel:646-312-4590), or in person at NVC 2-272.

Please note that the instructor cannot provide accommodations unless requested by SDS.

#### Religious Accomodations

It is [CUNY policy](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/reasonable-accommodations-and-academic-adjustments/vi-religious-accommodations/) to provide accommodations for students' sincerely held religious beliefs. If a religious accommodation is requested, please contact the instructor at least two weeks in advance.

#### Unexcused Abscence Policy

Attendance is not required, but lecture recordings will not be provided. Students are responsible for the content of all sessions missed.

## Personal Resources[^2]

Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. 

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. 

#### Mental Health Resources

If you or anyone you know experiences significant academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support.

The [Baruch Counselling Center](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/counseling/)
is here to help. You can visit them in person at 137 E 25th St, 9th floor  or
call them at [646-312-2155](tel:646-312-2155) during normal business hours;
you can make an appointment online
[here](https://baruch.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a4NCaYrV2Sk1cyg). 
For more immediate support, please call NYC WELL 
([1-888-NYC-WELL](tel:646-312-2155) or [1-888-692-9355](tel:1-888-692-9355)).[^3] 

Asking for help is often difficult: consider reaching out to a friend, family, or a member of the faculty you trust for help getting connected to support that can help. 

If you are worried about a friend or classmate, consider reaching out to the
[Baruch Campus Intervention
Team](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/campus-intervention-team/).

#### Physical Health

[Healthy CUNY](https://www.healthycuny.org/) promotes well-being and a culture
of health in order to foster the academic and life success of all CUNY students.
They can connect you with a variety of 
[campus-](https://www.healthycuny.org/cuny-health-centers) and
[community](https://www.healthycuny.org/community-health-resources)-based
healthcare providers. 

[Baruch Health Services](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/health/) provides
students with a full range of clinical health services. Call
[646-312-2040](tel:646-312-2040) or email
[StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu](mailto:StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu)
to make an appointment.

#### Food Security

All CUNY students have access to [CUNY Food
Pantries](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/transformation/cuny-cares/food-pantry/) 
located throughout the five boroughs, thanks to the [CUNY CARES](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/transformation/cuny-cares/) 
program. CUNY CARES is also able to help qualifying students with [SNAP 
("Food Stamps") enrollment](https://www.cuny.edu/current-students/student-affairs/student-services/snap/).

On campus, you can also access the [Bearcat Food
Pantry](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/dean-of-students/bearcat-food-pantry/).

#### Financial Security

Baruch students experiencing heightened financial stress have access to
[Student Emergency Grants](https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/dean-of-students/emergencyfunds/)
administered through the Office of the Dean of Students. 

Note that funds are also available for students experiencing immigration-related
financial stress.

#### Immigration Status

[CUNY Citizenship Now!](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/communications-marketing/citizenship-now/) 
provides confidential, high-quality immigration law services to all CUNY students. 

Note that Citizenship Now!'s primary Manhattan office is located in the Heights, 
not on the Baruch campus and that an appointment is strongly recommended. Call
[646-664-9350](tel:646-664-9350) during business hours for more information.
