## Research Report #{{< meta rr_num >}}: {{< meta rr_title >}}


### Submission Instructions

Submit your research report as a PDF of 6-8 pages on Brightspace.[^pdf]
Your submission should include all *essential* code, *e.g.*, code
used to fit models or to perform simulations, but may omit
*incidental* code, *e.g.* code used to create figures or import
data. 

You are **required** to implement ML methods by hand; use of 'built-in'
ML functionality is disallowed unless authorized by instructor. You may use
built-in linear algebra subroutines and are not required to, *e.g.*, implement
matrix multiplication from scratch. While you must use your own implementation
of ML methods, it is smart to compare against existing 'reference' implementations.

Your report should be in the style of a technical "blog post", accessible
to someone who is just getting into Machine Learning but has solid
background in the prerequisite subjects (*e.g.*, you on the day before
this class started). Make sure to (rigorously) define and prove all
results used. You should also cite relevant authoritative resources, 
*e.g.*, the recommended textbooks, where appropriate. 

Each student must submit an individual and independently written report, but you
are encouraged to work together with your peers to understand methods, design
simulations, review relevant literature, *etc.* I strongly recommend having a
classmate ["red-team"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) your report
before submission to find unclear writing, sub-standard figures and tables, 
unconvincing simulations, incorrect  code, *etc.* 

[^pdf]: If you wish to use an alternate submission format to allow
interactive and/or animated elements, please seek pre-approval from
the instructor. 

### Grading 

Your submission will be evaluated *holistically* and graded out of 100
points. The following rubric will guide this holistic evaluation, but
the instructor may deviate as necessary to accurately grade the final
submission. 

::: {.list-table width="1,1,1,1,1,1" aligns="c,c,c,c,c,c" header-rows=1 .hover}

 * - Report Element
   - Excellent. <br> "A-" to "A" (`90% to 100%`)
   - Great. <br> "B-" to "B+" (`80% to 89%`)
   - Average. <br> "C" to "C+" (`73% to 79%`)
   - Poor. <br> "D" to "C-" (`60% to 72%`)
   - Failure. <br> "F" (`0% to 59%`)
   
 * - Presentation (15%)
   - Report has excellent formatting, with particularly effective 
     tables and figures. Tables and Figures are "publication-quality"
     and clearly and succinctly support claims made in the body text.
   - Report has strong formatting; tables and figures make their
     intended points, but do not do so optimally. 
   - Formatting is average; tables and figures do not clearly support
     arguments made in the text and/or are not "publication quality"
   - Poor formatting distracts from substance of report. Tables and
     Figures exhibit significant deficiencies in formatting.  
   - Formatting prohibits or significantly impairs reader understanding.
 
 * - Project Skeleton (15%)
   - Report includes all required elements and goes significantly deeper
     than required by the project skeleton in a manner that provides 
     additional insights. 
     
     Mathematical definitions and proofs are clearly stated. 
     
   - Report includes all required elements and dives deeper into the
     topic, but does not generate additional insights. (*E.g.*,
     additional simulations showing the same phenomena)
     
     Mathematical definitions and proofs are correctly stated, but 
     clarity could be improved. 
     
   - Report includes all required elements. 
   
     Mathematical definitions and proofs are essentially correct,
     but difficult to understand and/or contain trivial errors.
   
   - Report does not include all required elements, but is still
     able to capture key points. 
     
     Mathematical definitions and proofs contain significant, but
     non-fatal, errors. 
   - Report fails to adequately address the topic. 
   
     Mathematical definitions and proofs are fundamentally incorrect. 
 
 * - Algorithms and Computational Efficiency (20%)
   - Report implements all methods efficiently with high-quality,
     well-formatted and performant code. 
   - Report implements all methods efficiently with acceptable
     code quality. 
   - Report implements all methods, but does not do so efficiently
     and/or with substandard code. 
   - Report uses built-in methods instead of implementing methods
     from scratch
   - Code does not appear to run properly / insufficient code submitted. 
 
 * - Methodological Aspects and Simulation Design(20%)
   - Methods are accurately and correctly implemented in a robust / bullet-proof
     manner, designed to responsibly check for and address possible modes of
     failure. Simulations clearly and efficiently support all claims. 
   - Methods are accurately and correctly implemented, but are not robust to
     failure. Simulations clearly and efficiently support all claims. 
   - Methods are implemented with minor harmless errors and/or poor validation.
     Simulations do not fully support claims. 
   - Methods are implemented with significant errors leading to incorrect results. 
   
     Simulations do not give sufficient support for key claims.
   - Methods are not correctly implemented. Simulations do not support claims.
 
 * - Communication and Writing (20%)
   - Report exhibits excellent written communication, making all points
     exceptionally clearly and at the level of a quality academic
     publication. Code, results, and text are skillfully woven together.
   - Report exhibits great written communication, all points are made
     clearly without notable grammatical errors. Code, results, and
     text are neatly tied together. 
   - Report exhibits solid written communication, key points are made 
     understandably and any grammatical errors do not impair
     understanding. Code, results, and text could be better integrated, 
     but it is clear which elements relate. 
   - Written communication is below standard: points are not always
     understandable and/or grammatical errors actively distract from
     content. Code, results, and text are not actively integrated, but
     are generally located 'near' each other in a semi-systematic fashion.
   - Written communication is far below standard, possibly bordering
     on unintelligible. Large blocks of code are shown without any
     relevant results or text. 
 
 * - Contextualization (10%)
   - Report draws on relevant, modern research literature to give context
     to its findings and to broaden its scope. 
   - Report draws on standard textbooks and/or classical research literature
     to give context to its findings and to broaden its scope. 
   - Report cites textbooks to give context, but does not take a 'big picture' 
     view. 
   - Report gives appropriate context, but lacks citations. 
   - Report gives limited, insufficient context.
