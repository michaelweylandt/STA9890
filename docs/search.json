    "text": "Academic Integrity Policy\nI fully support CUNY’s Policy on Academic Integrity, which states, in part:\n\nAcademic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York. Penalties for academic dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion.\n\n\nAcademic integrity is at the core of a college or university education. Faculty assign essays, exams, quizzes, projects, and so on both to extend the learning done in the classroom and as a means of assessing that learning. When students violate the academic integrity policy (i.e., “cheat”), they are committing an act of theft that can cause real harm to themselves and others including, but not limited to, their classmates, their faculty, and the caregivers who may be funding their education. Academic dishonesty confers an unfair advantage over others, which undermines educational equity and fairness. Students who cheat place their college’s accreditation and their own future prospects in jeopardy.\n\nIn this course, expectations for academic integrity are straightforward: no use of unauthorized materials on weekly quizzes or mid-semester tests. Unless explicitly stated otherwise by the instructor in writing, the only authorized materials allowed during in class assessment are the instructor-provided formula sheets.\nAcademic sanctions in this class will range from an F on the Assignment to an F in this Course. A report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent to the Office of the Dean of Students.\nStudents are encouraged to contact the instructor with any questions or concerns related to matters of academic integrity."

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.\nAll of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.\n\nMental Health Resources\nIf you or anyone you know experiences significant academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support.\nThe Baruch Counselling Center is here to help. You can visit them in person at 137 E 25th St, 9th floor or call them at 646-312-2155 during normal business hours; you can make an appointment online here. For more immediate support, please call NYC WELL (1-888-NYC-WELL or 1-888-692-9355).2\nAsking for help is often difficult: consider reaching out to a friend, family, or a member of the faculty you trust for help getting connected to support that can help.\nIf you are worried about a friend or classmate, consider reaching out to the Baruch Campus Intervention Team.\n\n\nPhysical Health\nHealthy CUNY promotes well-being and a culture of health in order to foster the academic and life success of all CUNY students. They can connect you with a variety of campus- and community-based healthcare providers.\nBaruch Health Services provides students with a full range of clinical health services. Call 646-312-2040 or email StudentHealthCareCenter@baruch.cuny.edu to make an appointment.\n\n\nFood Security\nAll CUNY students have access to CUNY Food Pantries located throughout the five boroughs, thanks to the CUNY CARES program. CUNY CARES is also able to help qualifying students with SNAP (“Food Stamps”) enrollment.\nOn campus, you can also access the Bearcat Food Pantry.\n\n\nFinancial Security\nBaruch students experiencing heightened financial stress have access to Student Emergency Grants administered through the Office of the Dean of Students.\nNote that funds are also available for students experiencing immigration-related financial stress.\n\n\nImmigration Status\nCUNY Citizenship Now! provides confidential, high-quality immigration law services to all CUNY students.\nNote that Citizenship Now!’s primary Manhattan office is located in the Heights, not on the Baruch campus and that an appointment is strongly recommended. Call 646-664-9350 during business hours for more information."
