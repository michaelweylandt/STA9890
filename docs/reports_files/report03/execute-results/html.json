By reducing a large number of features to a smaller\nnumber of linearly independent (uncorrelated) components, PCA is often said\nto increase interpretability. This assumes a degree of \"reification\" - is the PC\nsomething meaningful on its own? \n\nIf the PC captures a true underlying factor, then perhaps we have found\nsomething worth interpreting; but PCA always finds some sort of factorization,\neven when there is no \"true\" underlying factor. In some circumstances, this PC\nbecomes a thing in itself, *e.g.*, IQ, but that cannot always be assumed. If we\ndo not assume or define a meaning to the PC, it can only be understood as a\ncombination of all of the features used to create it, hardly a paragon of\ninterpretability. \n\nSparse PCA takes a different approach: rather than finding an interpretation of\nthe linear combination of all features that captures the most variance, it seeks\na linear combination of only a few features that explain nearly-the-most variance.\nBecause only a few features are used, the resulting PC is more interpretable\n*a priori* than the output of classical PCA. \n\nAs background, you should read the paper by Weylandt and Swiler[^beyondpca] and\nreview the [Supporting Materials](https://zenodo.org/records/10581710) to see how\nSparse PCA can be applied in a scientific setting. For more methodological \nbackground, see the references cited therein, especially the paper by Witten \n*et al.*, as well as ISL §6.3.1 and §12.2 and SLS §8.1-8.2.2. \n\n[^beyondpca]: M. Weylandt and L.P. Swiler. \"Beyond PCA: Additional Dimension\nReduction Techniques to Consider in the Development of Climate Fingerprints\". \n*Journal of Climate* **37(5)**, p.1723-1735. 2024.

Which does better when the \"true\" PCs are dense?\n      When they are sparse? Does this depend on the sample size? How can we\n      measure accuracy of the estimated PCs? \n  - On Real Data: Identify a real data set where PCA can be applied. Apply both\n    classical and sparse PCA and compare the results. Which PCA is better (in\n    whatever sense)? Which PCA is more interepretable? Is there a way to\n    validate your interpretation?\n    \n[^convergence]: Recall that PCs are only defined \"up to sign\". If $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$\nis a valid PC, so is $-\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$. You will need to modify your usual\nconvergence checks to account for this. \n  \n  \n### Additional Background\n\nThe *Power Method* is a classical approach to computing eigenvectors and, by\nextension, singular vectors. For this research report, you will build upon\nthe singular vector variant, so I review the eigenvector variant here. \n\nSuppose $\\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}_{\\succ 0}$ is a strictly positive \ndefinite $p \\times p$ matrix. By the spectral theorem, it has an\neigendecomposition: \n\n$$\\mathbf{\\Sigma} = \\sum_{i=1}^p \\lambda_i \\mathbf{v}_i\\mathbf{v}_i^{\\top}$$\n\nwhere the eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$ are decreasing and strictly positive: \n($\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\dots \\geq \\lambda_p$). If the eigenvalues are\ndistinct (as they are with probability 1 for continuous-valued data observed\nnoisly), then this decomposition is unique up to sign.[^sign]\n\nThe *power method* for computing the leading (highest eigenvalue) eigenvector\nof $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ proceeds as follows: \n\n- Initialize: select $\\mathbf{v}^{(0)}$ as a random unit vector\n- Repeat Until Convergence: \n  - Multiply: $\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{v}^{(k)}$\n  - Normalize: $\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{(k+1)} / \\|\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}^{(k+1)}\\|_2$\n  - Iterate: $k \\leftarrow k + 1$\n- Return: At convergence, return the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}^{(k)}$ and the\n  eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\|\\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{v}^{(k)}\\|_2$\n\nAdditional eigenvectors can be found by \"deflating\" $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ and \napplying the power method to $$\\mathbf{\\Sigma}' = \\mathbf{\\Sigma} - \\lambda \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\top}.$$\n\nSo long as the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ are distinct, the power method\nconverges to the leading eigenvector as long as the initial guess is not\nperfectly orthogonal to the true eigenvector. If we pick our initial guess\nrandomly, this is a very reasonable assumption. To see why this is the case,\nnote that: \n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{v}^{(k)} &\\propto \\mathbf{\\Sigma}^k \\mathbf{v}^{(0)} \\\\\n                 &= \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^p \\lambda_i^k \\mathbf{v}_i\\mathbf{v}_i^{\\top}\\right)\\mathbf{v}^{(0)} \\\\\n                 &= \\sum_{i=1}^p \\lambda_i^k \\langle\\mathbf{v}_i, \\mathbf{v}^{(0)}\\rangle \\mathbf{v}_i\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nViewed here, you can see why the power method has its name. As $k \\to \\infty$,\nthe first term in this series becomes much much larger than the others, so we get\n\n$$\\mathbf{v}^{(k)} \\buildrel \\sim \\over \\propto \\lambda_1^k \\langle\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}^{(0)}\\rangle \\mathbf{v}_1$$\nAfter normalizing and dropping the scalar terms, we have\n\n$$\\mathbf{v}^{(k)} \\to \\mathbf{v}_1$$ \n\nas desired. This argument also clarifies the two possible failure modes of the\npower method: \n\ni) If the initial guess is unlucky and orthogonal to the true eigenvector, we\n   have $\\langle \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}^{(0)} \\rangle = 0$ so the \n   $\\mathbf{v}_1$ term drops out of the answer and we converge to the next \n   eigenvector (unless we are orthogonal to that one as well).\nii) If the eigenvalues are not distinct, then multiple terms become large\n    and we get a strange 'superposition' of multiple eigenvectors. (Alternatively,\n    there isn't a 'true' right answer, but we get one possible eigenvector.)\n\n[^sign]: Note that we can  substitute $\\mathbf{v}_i \\to -\\mathbf{v}_i$ without changing the result since the minus signs will cancel in $(-\\mathbf{v}_i)(-\\mathbf{v}_i)^{\\top} = \\mathbf{v}_i\\mathbf{v}_i^{\\top}$.\n\n### Potential Topics for Additional Research\n\nWhile the main focus of this report is on *Sparse PCA*, a suitably sparsified\nSVD can be used for a wide variety of multivariate analysis problems. You may\nwish to extend your analysis to other sparse multivariate methods, such as \n*Sparse CCA* or *Sparse PLS*. \n\nAlternatively, a huge number of approaches to Sparse PCA have been proposed, not\nall of which are based on the power method. You may wish to compare the approach\nI prefer (projected power method) with other approaches: be sure to consider \ni) accuracy; ii) interpretability; and iii) computational ease / efficiency \nin your comparison. \n\n### Submission Instructions\n\nSubmit your research report as a PDF of 6-8 pages on Brightspace.[^pdf]\nYour submission should include all *essential* code, *e.g.*, code\nused to fit models or to perform simulations, but may omit\n*incidental* code, *e.g.* code used to create figures or import\ndata. \n\nYou are **required** to implement ML methods by hand; use of 'built-in'\nML functionality is disallowed unless authorized by instructor. You may use\nbuilt-in linear algebra subroutines and are not required to, *e.g.*, implement\nmatrix multiplication from scratch. While you must use your own implementation\nof ML methods, it is smart to compare against existing 'reference' implementations.\n\nYour report should be in the style of a technical \"blog post\", accessible\nto someone who is just getting into Machine Learning but has solid\nbackground in the prerequisite subjects (*e.g.*, you on the day before\nthis class started). Make sure to (rigorously) define and prove all\nresults used. You should also cite relevant authoritative resources, \n*e.g.*, the recommended textbooks, where appropriate. \n\nEach student must submit an individual and independently written report, but you\nare encouraged to work together with your peers to understand methods, design\nsimulations, review relevant literature, *etc.* I strongly recommend having a\nclassmate [\"red-team\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) your report\nbefore submission to find unclear writing, sub-standard figures and tables, \nunconvincing simulations, incorrect code, *etc.* Per the course's [Academic\nIntegrity Policy](../resources.html#aipolicy), you must explicitly acknowledge\nall collaborators in your submission.\n\n[^pdf]: If you wish to use an alternate submission format to allow\ninteractive and/or animated elements, please seek pre-approval from\nthe instructor. \n\n### Grading \n\nYour submission will be evaluated *holistically* and graded out of 100\npoints. The following rubric will guide this holistic evaluation, but\nthe instructor may deviate as necessary to accurately grade the final\nsubmission. \n\n::: {.list-table width=\"1,1,1,1,1,1\" aligns=\"c,c,c,c,c,c\" header-rows=1 .hover}\n\n * - Report Element\n   - Excellent. <br> \"A-\" to \"A\" (`90% to 100%`)\n   - Great. <br> \"B-\" to \"B+\" (`80% to 89%`)\n   - Average. <br> \"C\" to \"C+\" (`73% to 79%`)\n   - Poor. <br> \"D\" to \"C-\" (`60% to 72%`)\n   - Failure. <br> \"F\" (`0% to 59%`)\n   \n * - Presentation (15%)\n   - Report has excellent formatting, with particularly effective \n     tables and figures.
