Unsupervised learning: 

- Discovering patterns which we hope will hold true in future samples

Types of problems:

- Groups
- Regularity / Patterns
- Outlier Detection
- Prototypes/Archetypes

How to validate? 

- No 'magic' like hold-out sets
- Stability principle
- Hopefully doesn't matter too much (robustness)
- Success on a downstream class
- Often very specific strategies for individual problems

Math Review

- Eigendecomposition
- Multivariate Normal
- SVD
