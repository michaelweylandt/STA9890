You may use\nbuilt-in linear algebra subroutines and are not required to, *e.g.*, implement\nmatrix multiplication from scratch. While you must use your own implementation\nof ML methods, it is smart to compare against existing 'reference' implementations.\n\nYour report should be in the style of a technical \"blog post\", accessible\nto someone who is just getting into Machine Learning but has solid\nbackground in the prerequisite subjects (*e.g.*, you on the day before\nthis class started). Make sure to (rigorously) define and prove all\nresults used. You should also cite relevant authoritative resources, \n*e.g.*, the recommended textbooks, where appropriate. \n\nEach student must submit an individual and independently written report, but you\nare encouraged to work together with your peers to understand methods, design\nsimulations, review relevant literature, *etc.* I strongly recommend having a\nclassmate [\"red-team\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) your report\nbefore submission to find unclear writing, sub-standard figures and tables, \nunconvincing simulations, incorrect  code, *etc.* \n\n[^pdf]: If you wish to use an alternate submission format to allow\ninteractive and/or animated elements, please seek pre-approval from\nthe instructor. \n\n### Grading \n\nYour submission will be evaluated *holistically* and graded out of 100\npoints. The following rubric will guide this holistic evaluation, but\nthe instructor may deviate as necessary to accurately grade the final\nsubmission. \n\n::: {.list-table width=\"1,1,1,1,1,1\" aligns=\"c,c,c,c,c,c\" header-rows=1 .hover}\n\n * - Report Element\n   - Excellent. <br> \"A-\" to \"A\" (`90% to 100%`)\n   - Great. <br> \"B-\" to \"B+\" (`80% to 89%`)\n   - Average. <br> \"C\" to \"C+\" (`73% to 79%`)\n   - Poor. <br> \"D\" to \"C-\" (`60% to 72%`)\n   - Failure. <br> \"F\" (`0% to 59%`)\n   \n * - Presentation (15%)\n   - Report has excellent formatting, with particularly effective \n     tables and figures. Tables and Figures are \"publication-quality\"\n     and clearly and succinctly support claims made in the body text.\n   - Report has strong formatting; tables and figures make their\n     intended points, but do not do so optimally. \n   - Formatting is average; tables and figures do not clearly support\n     arguments made in the text and/or are not \"publication quality\"\n   - Poor formatting distracts from substance of report. Tables and\n     Figures exhibit significant deficiencies in formatting.  \n   - Formatting prohibits or significantly impairs reader understanding.\n \n * - Project Skeleton (15%)\n   - Report includes all required elements and goes significantly deeper\n     than required by the project skeleton in a manner that provides \n     additional insights. \n     \n     Mathematical definitions and proofs are clearly stated. \n     \n   - Report includes all required elements and dives deeper into the\n     topic, but does not generate additional insights. (*E.g.*,\n     additional simulations showing the same phenomena)\n     \n     Mathematical definitions and proofs are correctly stated, but \n     clarity could be improved. \n     \n   - Report includes all required elements. \n   \n     Mathematical definitions and proofs are essentially correct,\n     but difficult to understand and/or contain trivial errors.\n   \n   - Report does not include all required elements, but is still\n     able to capture key points. \n     \n     Mathematical definitions and proofs contain significant, but\n     non-fatal, errors. \n   - Report fails to adequately address the topic. \n   \n     Mathematical definitions and proofs are fundamentally incorrect. \n \n * - Algorithms and Computational Efficiency (20%)\n   - Report implements all methods efficiently with high-quality,\n     well-formatted and performant code. \n   - Report implements all methods efficiently with acceptable\n     code quality. \n   - Report implements all methods, but does not do so efficiently\n     and/or with substandard code. \n   - Report uses built-in methods instead of implementing methods\n     from scratch\n   - Code does not appear to run properly / insufficient code submitted. \n \n * - Methodological Aspects and Simulation Design(20%)\n   - Methods are accurately and correctly implemented in a robust / bullet-proof\n     manner, designed to responsibly check for and address possible modes of\n     failure. Simulations clearly and efficiently support all claims. \n   - Methods are accurately and correctly implemented, but are not robust to\n     failure. Simulations clearly and efficiently support all claims. \n   - Methods are implemented with minor harmless errors and/or poor validation.\n     Simulations do not fully support claims. \n   - Methods are implemented with significant errors leading to incorrect results. \n   \n     Simulations do not give sufficient support for key claims.\n   - Methods are not correctly implemented. Simulations do not support claims.\n \n * - Communication and Writing (20%)\n   - Report exhibits excellent written communication, making all points\n     exceptionally clearly and at the level of a quality academic\n     publication. Code, results, and text are skillfully woven together.\n   - Report exhibits great written communication, all points are made\n     clearly without notable grammatical errors. Code, results, and\n     text are neatly tied together. \n   - Report exhibits solid written communication, key points are made \n     understandably and any grammatical errors do not impair\n     understanding. Code, results, and text could be better integrated, \n     but it is clear which elements relate. \n   - Written communication is below standard: points are not always\n     understandable and/or grammatical errors actively distract from\n     content. Code, results, and text are not actively integrated, but\n     are generally located 'near' each other in a semi-systematic fashion.\n   - Written communication is far below standard, possibly bordering\n     on unintelligible. Large blocks of code are shown without any\n     relevant results or text. \n \n * - Contextualization (10%)\n   - Report draws on relevant, modern research literature to give context\n     to its findings and to broaden its scope. \n   - Report draws on standard textbooks and/or classical research literature\n     to give context to its findings and to broaden its scope. \n   - Report cites textbooks to give context, but does not take a 'big picture' \n     view. \n   - Report gives appropriate context, but lacks citations. \n   - Report gives limited, insufficient context.\n\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis work Â©2025 by [Michael Weylandt](https://michael-weylandt.com) is licensed\nunder a [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA \n4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en) license.\n![](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/88x31/png/by-nc-sa.png){width=\"10%\"}\n\n",
