## Research Report #{{< meta rr_num >}}: {{< meta rr_title >}}

In this Research Report, you will explore concepts of *Machine Learning
Fairness* and see how ensemble learning techniques can be used to create a
"fair" ensemble from "unfair" base learners.[^arxiv] Along the way, you will

i)   Use a black-box optimizer to implement a form of regularized logistic
     regression
ii)  Design and implement a custom ensemble learning strategy
iii) Implement and Assess Various ML Fairness Metrics

[^arxiv]: This Research Report is adapted from my ongoing research collaboration
with Camille Little (Rice University) and Genevera Allen (Columbia University).
A now-somewhat-dated manuscript describing our work in this space can be found
online at [ArXiv 2206.00074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00074). 

### Project Skeleton

Your report should be divided into three sections, covering the
following: 

i)   Background on ML Fairness
ii)  Computation - Implementing Regularized Logistic Regression with 
     `CVXR` or `cvxpy`
iii) Implementation and Assessment of the FairStacks Ensembling Method

At a minimum, these should include the following elements: 

- Background on ML Fairness
  - Social background, including two examples of bias in automated decision
    systems
  - Overview of definitions used to measure ML Fairness
  - Identification and import of a real data set on which we can evaluate
    the proposed methodology. Be sure to describe both the "raw" data and the
    fairness metric you are interested in. If there is relevant social context, 
    be sure to describe that as well. 
- Computation
  - Introduction to the `CVX` optimization framework
  - Implementation of the following classification methods as base learners
    to be used in construction of the FairStacks ensemble:
    - Naive Bayes (no `CVX`)
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (no `CVX`)
    - Support Vector Machines (use `CVX`)
    - Logistic Regression (use `CVX`): plain, ridge, and lasso variants
    - Decision trees (you may use an existing implementation - use individual 
      tree(s) here, not a full random forest)
- Implementation and Assessment of FairStacks
  - Define the FairStacks Ensembling Problem, taking care to describe both
    the choice of loss function (logistic loss)[^logloss], regularization and
    any constraints used
  - Implement the FairStacks Problem using `CVX`
  - Implement a full model building (train-validation/ensembling-test split)
    pipeline to implement FairStacks robustly
  - Apply the FairStacks pipeline to your real data set and chosen fairness
    metric
  - Compute the fairness and accuracy obtained by the FairStacks ensemble and
    compare it with the fairness and accuracy of the individual base learners.
    Does FairStacks succeed in its goal of improving both accuracy and fairness?

[^logloss]: In the FairStacks paper, we used OLS as a classification method for
somewhat technical reasons. For this Research Report, you should use logistic
loss as your primary loss function. It may be an interesting extension to compare
against OLS. 

### Additional Background

#### ML Fairness

As ML systems continue to permate our society, increasing interest has been paid
to their effects on society. ML systems are highly effective at replicating
the characteristics of their training data - both good (accuracy) and bad 
(bias).[^chatbot] The book BHN reviews this emerging area in some detail. 

For our purposes, we can restrict our attention to 'fair classification', *i.e.*,
making sure that ML systems treat different groups 'equally' (BHN §3). There are
many definitions of 'equally' that can be appropriate, depending on the problem. 
In the simplest, *demographic parity*, the ML system should give the same fraction
of positive (+1) labels to all demographic groups; this is the type of fairness
embodied by phrases like "looks like America". We quantify this with measures 
like *deviation from demographic parity*. If we divide our population into two
groups $\mathcal{G}_1, \mathcal{G}_2$, the deviation from demographic parity
associated with a classifier $f: \mathbb{R}^p \to \{0, 1\}$ is given by: 

$$\text{DDP}(f) = \left|\frac{1}{|\mathcal{G}_1|}\sum_{i \in \mathcal{G}_1} f(\mathbf{x}_i) - \frac{1}{|\mathcal{G}_2|}\sum_{i \in \mathcal{G}_2} f(\mathbf{x}_i)\right| = \left|\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{G}_1} f(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{G}_2} f(\mathbf{x}) \right|$$

The 2018 FAccT Tutorial ["21 Fairness Definitions and Their
Politics"](https://fairmlbook.org/tutorial2.html) covers this and other fairnesss
metrics. For purposes of this project, you should consider the fairness metric
that is most appropriate to the social context surrounding your dataset of interest.
Note that, if your interest is in a non-US data set, the relevant subgroups and
legal doctrines may be significantly different than those (implicitly) assumed by
most of the FairML literature. 

[^chatbot]: The earliest entries in the modern era of chatbots were marked by
several flaws reflective their training data. Early iterations of the chat engine
built into the Bing search engine were often [rather overly-sexual and 
not-so-subtly malicious](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html),
perhaps reflecting the darker corners of the internet on which it was trained.

#### FairStacks

[FairStacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00074) is a novel ensemble learning
method which attempts to create a fair ensemble from a set of unfair base
learners. At the highest level, FairStacks generalizes the following idea: if
Approach A is biased *against* a group and Approach B is biased *in favor of* 
the same group, then Approach (A + B) will be approximately unbiased. 

To put FairStacks into practice, we modify our basic ensembling procedure: in
standard ensemble learning, we create a "model of models", finding weights
$\hat{\mathbf{w}}$ such that

$$ \hat{\mathbf{w}} = \text{arg min}_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \text{Loss}\left(\mathbf{y}, \sum_j w_j \hat{f}_j(\mathbf{x}_i)\right) $$

where the inner sum is taken over the base learners $\{\hat{f}_j\}$. We add
'fairness' in the form of a regularizer (penalty). If $\hat{b}_j$ is the
bias of base learner $\hat{f}_j$, FairStacks solves


$$ \hat{\mathbf{w}} = \text{arg min}_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \text{Loss}\left(\mathbf{y}, \sum_j w_j \hat{f}_j(\mathbf{x}_i)\right) + \underbrace{\lambda \left|\sum_j w_j \hat{b}_j\right|}_{\text{Fairness Penalty}}$$

By setting $\lambda$ large, we force the 'average bias' down to zero, resulting
in a fairer ensemble. See the paper for more details.

#### CVX

The `CVX` family of libraries attempt to make convex optimization easy and
accesible to a wide range of users. Implementations of `CVX` can be found in:

- Matlab: [the original `CVX`](https://cvxr.com/cvx/)
- Python: [`cvxpy`](https://www.cvxpy.org/)
- R: [`CVXR`](https://cvxr.rbind.io/)
- Julia: [`Convex.jl`](https://jump.dev/Convex.jl/stable/)

and more. While the details vary according to the host language, the essential
structure is unchanged. I demonstrate the use of `CVXR` here to implement
Lasso regression. 

```{r}
#| message: false
set.seed(100)  # For reproducibility
library(CVXR)  # Load CVXR
n <- 400       # Set up a moderately high-dimensional problem
p <- 1000
s <- 5
sigma <- 2

# Lasso works best for IID Gaussian data
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), 
            nrow=n, ncol=p)

# 'True' coefficients are mainly sparse with 5 non-zero values
beta_star <- matrix(rep(0, p), ncol=1)
beta_star[1:s] <- 3

# Generate observed response from OLS DGP
y <- X %*% beta_star + rnorm(n, sd=sigma)

## We are now ready to apply CVXR
####  Also see discussion at
####  https://www.cvxpy.org/examples/machine_learning/lasso_regression.html

beta <- Variable(p) # Create 'beta' as a CVX _variable_ to be optimized

# Per theory, about the right level of regularization to be used here
lambda  <- sigma * sqrt(s * log(p) / n) 
loss    <- 1/(2 * n) * sum((y - X %*% beta)^2) # MSE Loss
penalty <- lambda * sum(abs(beta))

objective <- Problem(Minimize(loss + penalty))
beta_hat  <- solve(objective)$getValue(beta)
```

We can see that this correctly finds the non-zero elements: 

```{r}
plot(beta_hat, 
     xlab="Coefficient Number", 
     ylab="Lasso Estimate", 
     main="CVX Lasso Solution", 
     col="red4", 
     pch=16)
```

If we look more closely, we see two important properties of the solution: 

i) Non-specialized solvers like `CVXR` cannot achieve *exact* zeros, 
   so it is useful to do a bit of post-processing (*e.g.*, `zapsmall()`).
   
   If we need _exact_ zeros, other approaches should be used
ii) The lasso solution exhibits _shrinkage_, as the estimate are
    systematically smaller than the true values

```{r}
head(beta_hat, n=10)
```

`CVX` is never the *optimal* approach for a given problem, but it is an
incredibly useful tool for prototyping and trying out interesting new
approaches without putting in the effort to derive and implement a
specialized algorithm. (Tools like `tensorflow` and `pytorch` take this
idea even further, but require significantly more effort to learn. If you
are interested in working in ML after this course ends, they are a great
place to invest your time.)

The documentation for the `CVX` packages has several examples which will be
of use for you. 

### Possible Topic(s) for Additional Research

#### Algorithms for Regularized Logistic Regression

For this report, you are not required to fit the FairStacks problem "by hand"
and can use `CVX` instead. While `CVX` is flexible and easy to use, it rarely
performs as efficiently as a hand-coded tailored algorithm. You may want to 
explore the use of convex optimization algorithms for fitting logistic regression
problems generally and the FairStacks problem specifically. 

While the gradient descent method you used in [Research Report #01](./report01.html)
can be applied here, it is likely to be unbearably slow. You may achieve better
performance using a **Newton** or **Quadratic Approximation** approach. These
approaches use a (second-order) Taylor expansion to approximate the objective
function by a quadratic function; that quadratic function has a closed-form 
minimizer (essentially the OLS solution) which is used to update the iterate.[^gd]
A new approximation is created at the new iterate, solved again, *etc.* See
BV §9.5 for details. This approach is widely used to fit *generalized linear
models* such as logistic regression. In the statistics literature, you may see
it described as Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares or Fisher Scoring; see, 
*e.g.*, the output of `summary` on a `glm` fit in `R`.

[^gd]: For this approach, you should use the matrix-analytic closed-form OLS
solution instead of using 'internal' gradient descent. The aim of Newton methods
is to avoid gradient descent.

#### Alternative Fair ML Proposals

The FairStacks approach is far from the only Fair ML proposal in the literature.
If this is a topic that interest you, you may want to compare FairStacks to other
proposals and see which performs the best on your data set and which achieves
an acceptable level of fairness. (Not all methods can achieve all levels of 
fairness). Even though FairStacks worked the best on the problems we considered, 
it may not be the best for your data set - there is no free lunch after all!

#### Additional Randomization

As discussed in class, ensemble methods work best when the base learners exhibit
relatively low degrees of correlation. (If all base learners make the same
prediction, it does not matter how they are weighted in the ensemble.) This
is often particularly difficult to guarantee when applying powerful ML techniques
to not-too-difficult prediction problems, as any technique worth knowing will
perform reasonably well. In the FairStacks paper, we used a novel technique
called *mini-patching*[^mp] to increase the variance of the base learner ensemble: 
mini-patching works by taking small subsets of both rows (observations) and 
columns (features) and fitting base learners to these subsets. We then fit
the mini-patched learners using the FairStacks ensembling approach. 

Does this technique improve the performance of FairStacks on your data set? 
Are there other techniques you can use to create alternative / better base
learners to use in your ensemble?

[^mp]: Mini-**P**atching is related to, but should not be confused with the more
common technique of Mini-**B**atching. 

### Submission Instructions

Submit your research report as a PDF of 6-8 pages on Brightspace.[^pdf]
Your submission should include all *essential* code, *e.g.*, code
used to fit models or to perform simulations, but may omit
*incidental* code, *e.g.* code used to create figures or import
data. 

You are **required** to implement ML methods by hand; use of 'built-in'
ML functionality is disallowed unless authorized by instructor. You may use
built-in linear algebra subroutines and are not required to, *e.g.*, implement
matrix multiplication from scratch. While you must use your own implementation
of ML methods, it is smart to compare against existing 'reference' implementations.

Your report should be in the style of a technical "blog post", accessible
to someone who is just getting into Machine Learning but has solid
background in the prerequisite subjects (*e.g.*, you on the day before
this class started). Make sure to (rigorously) define and prove all
results used. You should also cite relevant authoritative resources, 
*e.g.*, the recommended textbooks, where appropriate. 

Each student must submit an individual and independently written report, but you
are encouraged to work together with your peers to understand methods, design
simulations, review relevant literature, *etc.* I strongly recommend having a
classmate ["red-team"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) your report
before submission to find unclear writing, sub-standard figures and tables, 
unconvincing simulations, incorrect  code, *etc.* Per the course's [Academic
Integrity Policy](../resources.html#aipolicy), you must explicitly acknowledge
all collaborators in your submission.

[^pdf]: If you wish to use an alternate submission format to allow
interactive and/or animated elements, please seek pre-approval from
the instructor. 

### Grading 

Your submission will be evaluated *holistically* and graded out of 100
points. The following rubric will guide this holistic evaluation, but
the instructor may deviate as necessary to accurately grade the final
submission.
